"The lobby is adorned with a myriad of colours,#filled with rivers of gold and... an endless horizon.##There are no doors behind you,#there is only one path forward.":3:4
"As you walk through the boundless halls,#an elevator materialises right in front of your vision,#along with whispers in your ear that#'all you seek is at the top of the tower'##'Go, then, escape the dusk.'":4:5
"That light at the end of the corridor still blinks,#there is nowhere to go but forward.##The darkness behind is encroaching fast.#Better get moving.":11:14
"'The cold is unforgiving, my child'#- a memory##'Weep not for me, my lamb'#- a vision##'Leave all behind. Embrace... nihility.'#- a premonition:14:16
"Every footstep...#Every moment...#Every breath...##Devastating.##It's almost as if the world came to a#standstill.##Still, that light shines at the end of the hall.:16:20
"The hall of embers.#A beautiful moment of serenity among the#disarray of this tower.#It's almost silent here, except for the occasional#crackle of the still-burning flames beside.:7:13
"I wouldn't call it a flawless flourish,#you know?#You really could have aced it had you#moved over just that little bit more.":9:12
"It is your first time back here, in so many years,# after all.#Maybe you need a refresher in gambling...":10:12
"Either way, I don't think you're up to the#challenge for the hall of frost.##How about the hall of embers?##Before you go though, take this: a set of#weighted dice.#You never know when cheating might he handy.":12:13
"Good job, it's pretty rare for people to so well.#I'm afraid the path ahead will be much more difficult#than anticipated.##'You never did tell me. Why am I here anyways?'##You really are forgetful.#You got yourself stuck in this dreamscape.":17:20
"Ah... You've made it.#I'm fairly surprised you managed to hold up#so well to all the anomalies.##You'll be heading to the hall of dreams next.":20:23
"Since you didn't utterly fail again there,#you'll have a choice for where you want to go.##Either pick the victor or loser's side,#no in betweens, just a choice.":18:21
"Come on. Pick yourself up and gamble better next time.#I don't want to have to clean up after you#every single goddamn time.##You'll be heading to the hall of curses next.":19:22
"I wish I could tell you the truth,#but my hands are tied as well.##None may speak of THEM and live to tell#the tale.#THEY do not look upon us proudly.":22:24
"For all that you know,#the hall of curses is only called such#because of its unending nature,#extending forever and forever until one#manages to break out of the cycle or ends#up stuck forever.##I hope you don't make the same mistake.":24:26

"Hey, didn't you hear?#Get up, stop daydreaming.##'What about those visions?'##Them? Only a representation of fate itself...##We will meet again.":36:36
"Dreams... a land of joy and also an eternal prison.#Perhaps you'll find what you want further down the road.##The voices shall guide you.##I'll see you then, capisce?":25:30
"You walk this path of your own volition...##I'm not going to stop you,#no one else will.##You won. Listen...":27:30
"'Denial won't bring you anything...'#- a moment#'Perhaps you'll find peace after I show you#'TRUTH'##Whatever. Like I told you, we write our own stories.":31:33
"Why the hell are you giving up?#You have a family,#you have friends,#write your hope into your reality!##'Me...? But the still ring clear...':34:35
